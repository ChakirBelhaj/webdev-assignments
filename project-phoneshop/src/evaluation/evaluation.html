We were rather shocked how inaccessable our weppage was. Luckily we did some things atleast right. The page is for example not really accessible
                                        Visually, the website is insufficient for visually impaired people.</p>
                                        <p>To regular users the usability of our webpage is positive.</p>

                                                    After an action is called, the user gets a message, wether the action was succesfull or not.

                                    <p>In our opinion this is an essential requirement for our webpage, the order of items presented on our webpage should make sense, this will prevent users from getting lost on our webpage.
                                    This Success Criterion may help people who rely on assistive technologies that read content aloud. The meaning evident in the sequencing of the information in the default presentation will be the same when the content is presented in spoken form.

                                        Such a user may interpret a field in the wrong context if the focus order is not logical. This will cause frustration amongst users.

                                            We did not use all HTML constructs listed in Appendix 1, because we misread the assignment. We only used one out off all the different pairs. This made our grade low. Trough canvas we sent a mail to the professor asking for a resubmission, because implementing all the constructs is not hard (for us).

                                            Next time we need to lower the opacity of the background photo to let the text become easier to read. We did lower the opacity, but too little to make the text clear.
